        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <img src="./images/IMG_2924.jpg" alt="self portrait of Kristen Hinojos" width="200">
        <p>I was born on March 28<sup>th</sup> 2002.</p>
        <p>I was raised here in <em>Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</em> Growing up, I would go to Mexico to visit my extended family every year, whether that was for Christmas or a few weeks during the summer. But now that I'm older and more busy with school and other activities, I don't go as often as I'd like. </p>  
        <p> Before coming to the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin, I was at the University of Ottawa studying in the Fine Arts program. I spent 4 years studying techniques, theories and history of art. In my final year of the program, I spent the last two terms (as well as other years) creating works related to Mexican culture, focusing on reconnection with my family roots and Mexican traditions that I dont get to experience from while living in Canada. The <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program is quite a change and different experience from the <abbr title="Bachelor of Fine Arts">BFA</abbr> Visual arts program at the UOttawa, but I have been enjoying it so far.

        <p>This is a quote I really like: </p><blockquote><q>If you cant fly, then run, if you can't run, then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.</q> -<cite>Martin Luther King Jr.</cite></blockquote>
